DETECTIVE: Hello. I’m Detective {male}. And, you are…

DETECTIVE: You are here today under suspicion of second degree robbery.
SUSPECT: {exc}!  
DETECTIVE That’s right. {num} {plur} were stolen from {stor} and the crime scene has your {body} written ALL over it.
SUSPECT: That is {word}.
DETECTIVE: Where were you on the night of {hol}?
SUSPECT: I was with {celeb}. We were watching the movie {movie}.
DETECTIVE: Then why does security camera footage show you {ending} just {dist} away from the crime scene?
SUSPECT: That’s a coincidence.
DETECTIVE: Alright, I’m through playing games. Where are you from?SUSPECT: {count}.
DETECTIVE: What did your parents do for a living?
SUSPECT: My father was a {obj} salesman and my mother was a {occ}.
DETECTIVE: Did they teach you to steal?
SUSPECT: No. I told you didn’t do it!
DETECTIVE: That’s enough! One of the best parts about being a detective is that I get to lock up criminals like you, and go home to my children and my pet [Animal] and say, [Famous Movie Quote].
SUSPECT: Fine, I did it. I committed the robbery. But I only did it because I needed the money to buy myself {body2} implants.
DETECTIVE: I knew it all along. And every time I solve a crime, I sing my favorite song, {child}

SUSPECT: You have a {adj} voice.
